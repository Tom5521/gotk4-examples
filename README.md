# Example of gotk4 widgets

I created this repository to save and/or share the usage of widgets in gotk4 for
anyone who might get lost in it (like me).

I also use it for when I forget how a widget works.

### As I learn how to use the library, I will be adding more widgets,but for now, this is what I have

The dependencies are simply the gotk4 library itself and gofakeit for filling in example data.

### The widget names are as they would be in the [GTK](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/index.html) documentation
